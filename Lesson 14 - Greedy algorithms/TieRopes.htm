        <br/>Tie adjacent ropes to achieve the maximum number of ropes of length >= K.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <p>There are N ropes numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose lengths are given in a zero-indexed array A, lying on the floor in a line. For each I (0 ≤ I &lt; N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I].</p>
    <p>We say that two ropes I and I + 1 are adjacent. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot, and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied again.</p>
    <p>For a given integer K, the goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is greater than or equal to K is maximal.</p>
    <p>For example, consider K = 4 and array A such that:</p>
    A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 1 A[5] = 1 A[6] = 3
    <p>The ropes are shown in the figure below.</p>
    <p>We can tie:</p>
    <code>
        rope 1 with rope 2 to produce a rope of length A[1] + A[2] = 5;
        <br/>rope 4 with rope 5 with rope 6 to produce a rope of length A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = 5.
    </code>
    <p>After that, there will be three ropes whose lengths are greater than or equal to K = 4. It is not possible to produce four such ropes.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <code>solution(K, A);</code>
    <p>that, given an integer K and a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of ropes of length greater than or equal to K that can be created.</p>
    <p>For example, given K = 4 and array A such that:</p>
    <code>
        A[0] = 1
        <br/>A[1] = 2
        <br/>A[2] = 3
        <br/>A[3] = 4
        <br/>A[4] = 1
        <br/>A[5] = 1
        <br/>A[6] = 3
    </code>
    <p>the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>
