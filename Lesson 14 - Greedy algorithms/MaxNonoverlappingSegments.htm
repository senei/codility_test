    <p>Task name: MaxNonoverlappingSegments
        <br/>Find a maximal set of non((-))overlapping segments.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <p>Located on a line are N segments, numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose positions are given in zero-indexed arrays A and B. For each I (0 ≤ I &lt; N) the position of segment I is from A[I] to B[I] (inclusive). The segments are sorted by their ends, which means that B[K] ≤ B[K + 1] for K such that 0 ≤ K &lt; N − 1.</p>
    <p>Two segments I and J, such that I ≠ J, are overlapping if they share at least one common point. In other words, A[I] ≤ A[J] ≤ B[I] or A[J] ≤ A[I] ≤ B[J].</p>
    <p>We say that the set of segments is non-overlapping if it contains no two overlapping segments. The goal is to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.</p>
    <p>For example, consider arrays A, B such that:</p>
    <code>A[0] = 1 B[0] = 5
        <br/>A[1] = 3 B[1] = 6
        <br/>A[2] = 7 B[2] = 8
        <br/>A[3] = 9 B[3] = 9
        <br/>A[4] = 9 B[4] = 10
    </code>
    <p>The size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments is 3. For example, possible sets are {0, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3} or {1, 2, 4}. There is no non-overlapping set with four segments.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <code>function solution(A, B);</code>
    <p>that, given two zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments.</p>
    <p>For example, given arrays A, B shown above, the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>
