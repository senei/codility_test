    <p>Task name: PassingCars
        <br/>Count the number of passing cars on the road.</p>
    <br/>
    <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3">codility.com/programmers/lessons/3</a>
    <br/>
    <p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.</p>
    <p>Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:</p>
    <code>0 represents a car traveling east,
        <br/>1 represents a car traveling west.</code>
    <p>The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 ≤ P &lt; Q &lt; N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.</p>
    <p>For example, consider array A such that:</p>
    <code>A[0] = 0
        <br/>A[1] = 1
        <br/>A[2] = 0
        <br/>A[3] = 1
        <br/>A[4] = 1</code>
    <p>We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <code>function solution(A);</code>
    <p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the number of passing cars. The function should return −1 if the number of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.</p>
    <p>For example, given:</p>
    <code>A[0] = 0
        <br/>A[1] = 1
        <br/>A[2] = 0
        <br/>A[3] = 1
        <br/>A[4] = 1</code>
    <p>the function should return 5, as explained above.</p>
