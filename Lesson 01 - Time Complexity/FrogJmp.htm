        <br/>Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.</p>
    <br/>
    <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/1">codility.com/programmers/lessons/1</a>
    <br/>
    <p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.</p>
    <p>Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <code>function solution(X, Y, D);</code>
    <p>that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.</p>
    <p>For example, given:</p>
    <code>X = 10
        <br/>Y = 85
        <br/>D = 30</code>
    <p>the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:</p>
    <code>after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
        <br/>after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
        <br/>after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100</code>
