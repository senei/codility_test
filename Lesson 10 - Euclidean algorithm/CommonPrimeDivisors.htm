        <br/>Check whether two numbers have the same prime divisors.</p>
    <br/>
    <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/10">codility.com/programmers/lessons/10</a>
    <br/>
    <p>
        A prime is a positive integer X that has exactly two distinct divisors: 1 and X. The first few prime integers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13.
    </p>
    <p>
        A prime D is called a prime divisor of a positive integer P if there exists a positive integer K such that D * K = P. For example, 2 and 5 are prime divisors of 20.</p>
    <p>You are given two positive integers N and M. The goal is to check whether the sets of prime divisors of integers N and M are exactly the same.</p>
    <p>For example, given:</p>
    <code>
        N = 15 and M = 75, the prime divisors are the same: {3, 5};
        <br/>N = 10 and M = 30, the prime divisors aren't the same: {2, 5} is not equal to {2, 3, 5};
        <br/>N = 9 and M = 5, the prime divisors aren't the same: {3} is not equal to {5}.</code>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    function solution(A, B);
    <p>that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B of Z integers, returns the number of positions K for which the prime divisors of A[K] and B[K] are exactly the same.</p>
    <p>For example, given:</p>
    <code>
        A[0] = 15 B[0] = 75
        <br/>A[1] = 10 B[1] = 30
        <br/>A[2] = 3 B[2] = 5</code>
    <p>the function should return 1, because only one pair (15, 75) has the same set of prime divisors.</p>
