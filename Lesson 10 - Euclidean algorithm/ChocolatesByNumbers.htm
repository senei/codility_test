    //  gcd = 2

    <p>Task name: ChocolatesByNumbers
        <br/>There are N chocolates in a circle. Count the number of chocolates you will eat.</p>
    <br/>
    <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/10">codility.com/programmers/lessons/10</a>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N − 1.
    </p>
    <p>You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.
    </p>
    <p>You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M − 1 chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.</p>
    <p>More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).
    </p>
    <p>You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.</p>
    <p>For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. You will eat the following chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.</p>
    <p>The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the above rules.</p>
    <p>Write a function:</p>
    <code>function solution(N, M);</code>
    <p>that, given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.</p>
    <p>For example, given integers N = 10 and M = 4. the function should return 5, as explained above.</p>
