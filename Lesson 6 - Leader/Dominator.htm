    <p>Task name: Dominator
        <br/>Find an index of an array such that its value occurs at more than half of indices in the array.</p>
    <br/>
    <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/6">codility.com/programmers/lessons/6</a>
    <br/>
    <p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.</p>
    <p>For example, consider array A such that</p>
    <code>A[0] = 3 A[1] = 4 A[2] = 3
        <br/>A[3] = 2 A[4] = 3 A[5] = -1
        <br/>A[6] = 3 A[7] = 3</code>
    <p>The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.</p>
    <p>Write a function</p>
    <code>int solution(int A[], int N);</code>
    <p>that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any element of array A in which the dominator of A occurs. The function should return âˆ’1 if array A does not have a dominator.</p>
